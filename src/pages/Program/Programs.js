                                The Los Angeles Mentorship Program (LAMP) provides UCLA students the opportunity to give back to the local
                                community through tutoring at University High School. This program aims to provide resources to underserved
                                youth - giving them access to SAT and ACT preparation along with workshops regarding financial literacy,
                                college applications, and more.

                                Students interested in tutoring and volunteering through LAMP are not required
                                nor expected to have previous experience, although strong interpersonal and communication skills are required
                                to succeed in the role.

                                this campus-wide speaker event is put on by students, for students. The aim of SPIEL is to give students from
                                all backgrounds the chance to talk about something that is not only important to the presenters themselves,
                                but is also often important to the greater UCLA and global community.
